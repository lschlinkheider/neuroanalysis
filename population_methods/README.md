# Module 5: Population methods
This is module one of the [Neural data science course](https://neural-data-science-course.github.io/).
This modules gives an overview of population methods, i.e. methods for making sense of the simultaneous activity of many neurons.
These technqiues are of increasing importance for system neuroscientists, due to the quickly increasing number of neurons simultaneously accessible with modern recording systems, and the importance of studying the collective behaviour of neural populations to understand their function.

## Lessons
01. Neural decoding with bayesian methods - 60 minutes 
02. Neural decoding with Support Vector Machines - 60 minutes
03. Dimensionality reduction - 60 minutes

## Prerequisites
To use material of this module profitably, you will need:  
* Familiarity with python and jupyter
* Basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra
* Basic knowledge of machine learning techniques

## Setup

**Install Pyhton and anaconda on your machine**  
If you don't have them already installed, install Pyhton and Anaconda on your machine.
Follow these instructions on [how to install anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

**Download the module folder**  
Clic on Code/Download Zip at the top of the page.  
Move the zipped folder in the directory of your choice and decompress it.  
Open the terminal and navigate to the module directory.


**Create a conda environment**  
Create a conda virtual environment with the name you prefer, then activate it to work within it.
Run

```
conda create --name env_name
conda activate env_name
```
 
**Install the module requirements**

Run in the terminal

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Open Jupyter**  
You can now open the lesson's notebooks in your favourite editor, or just type:

```
jupyter notebook
```

**All set!**  
You're all set to go throrugh the lessons.
