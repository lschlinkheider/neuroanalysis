Compute the Pearson correlation between true and estimated RFs for each duration to quantify the accuracy of the estimator. The Pearson correlation $\\mathrm{cc}$ is defined as\n",

As in the previous excercise, repeatedly estimate RF parameters for each condition (10 times) but this time also plot the standard deviation of the correlations across the different runs for each condition."
